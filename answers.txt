What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
The difference between a merge and a rebase is that a merge combines changes from one branch (the source branch) into 
another branch (the target branch). On the other hand, a rebase takes changes from one branch and applies them on top 
of another branch, essentially moving the entire branch to a new starting point on another branch, and creates a linear 
history without the merge commit.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a repository storing code directly on the git cloud, without it necessarily being on your 
local computer system.
